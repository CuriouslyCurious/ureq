# ureq

> Minimal request library in rust.

## Usage

```rust
// requires feature: `ureq = { version = "*", features = ["json"] }`
#[macro_use]
extern crate ureq;

fn main() {

    // sync post request of some json.
    let resp = ureq::post("https://myapi.acme.com/ingest")
        .set("X-My-Header", "Secret")
        .send_json(json!({
            "name": "martin",
            "rust": true
        }));

    // .ok() tells if response is 200-299.
    if resp.ok() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Features

To enable a minimal dependency tree, some features are off by default.
You can control them when including `ureq` as a dependency.

```
    ureq = { version = "*", features = ["json", "charset"] }
```

* `tls` enables https. This is enabled by default.
* `json` enables `response.into_json()` and `request.send_json()` serde json.
* `charset` enables interpreting the charset part of
  `Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1`. Without this, the library
  defaults to rust's built in `utf-8`.

## Motivation

  * Minimal dependency tree
  * Obvious API

This library tries to provide a convenient request library with a minimal dependency
tree and an obvious API. It is inspired by libraries like
[superagent](http://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/) and
[fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

### Sync (for now)

This library uses blocking socket reads and writes, for now.
The async story in rust is in heavy development and when used
currently pulls in a heavy dependency tree (tokio etc). Once
more async support is in rust core and won't drag those
dependencies, this library might change.


## TODO

- [x] Connection reuse/keep-alive with pool
- [ ] Expect 100-continue
- [ ] Forms with application/x-www-form-urlencoded
- [ ] multipart/form-data
- [ ] Use `rustls` when ring v0.13 is released.

## Usage

TODO

## Features

TODO

## Motivation

  * Minimal dependency tree
  * Obvious API
  * Convencience over correctness

This library tries to provide a convenient request library with a minimal dependency
tree and an obvious API. It is inspired by libraries like
[superagent](http://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/) and
[fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

This library does not try to enforce web standards correctness. It uses HTTP/1.1,
but whether the request is _perfect_ HTTP/1.1 compatible is up to the user of the
library. For example:

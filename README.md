> Minimal request library in rust.

## Motivation

  * Obvious API
  * Convencience over correctness
  * Minimal dependency tree

This library tries to provide a convenient request library with a minimal dependency
tree and an obvious API. It is inspired by libraries like
[superagent](http://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/) and
[fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).
